                Welcome to my webpage! As you can probably tell, this is my first webpage. <br> 
                Here I am going to tell you a little about myself. My name is Frank (usually go by Franky) Araujo and I am from Providence, RI. <br>
              I am a Computer Science major at URI. I chose this major because I have been interested in technology since I was a kid and its really <br>
              the only thing I can see myself doing for the rest of my life.I'm not really sure what I want to do exactly yet but I am <br>
              interested in cyber security. One thing I'm looking forward to in my CSC106 course is starting to learn the basics of computers. <br>
              
            </p>
              <p>Some things I like to do for fun are playing video games and playing basketball. Here's also another picture of me.
