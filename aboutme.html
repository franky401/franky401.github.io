       <p> Hello, My name is Franky Araujo and I am a Sophmore at URI. I am a computer science major <br>
                 and I took this class last year, but I was a serial procrasinator <br>
                 (sitll kind of am) and I ended up just barely missing a passing grade. But that was last year and <br>
                 I'm ready to show that I got what it takes to complete this class. I am from Providence, Rhode Island. <br>
                 Some things I enjoy doing are swimming and watching basketball.
             </p>
