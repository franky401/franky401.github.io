                Welcome to my webpage! As you can probably tell, this is my first webpage. 
                Here I am going to tell you a little about myself. My name is Frank (usuallly go by Franky) Araujo and I am from Providence, RI.
                I am a Computer Science major at URI. I chose this major because I havebeen interested in technology since I was a kid and its really the only
                thing I can see myself doing for the rest of my life. Im not really sure what I want to do exactly yet but I am interested in cyber security.
                One thing I'm looking forward to in my CSC106 course is starting to learn the basics of computers.
